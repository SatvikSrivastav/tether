Core Issues & Solutions:

1. Proxy Attendance (Friend marking for absent student)
- Implement facial recognition/selfie verification at time of marking attendance
- Require biometric authentication (fingerprint/Face ID)
- Random PIN verification that needs to be entered within seconds of display
- Multi-factor authentication combining location + another factor
- QR code scanning that changes every few minutes (displayed in class)

2. Location Accuracy Issues
- Use a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular triangulation
- Set appropriate geofence radius (not too tight, not too loose)
- Take multiple location samples over 30-60 seconds instead of a single ping
- Require students to stay in location for a minimum duration (prevent drive-by marking)
- Display real-time location accuracy to users and only allow marking when accuracy is within acceptable range

3. Location Services Disabled
- Prevent app functioning without location services enabled
- Regular background checks for location status
- Push notifications reminding users to enable location
- Mark attendance as "suspicious" if location was enabled just before marking
- Maintain logs of location service status changes

4. No Phone/Dead Battery Scenarios
- Provide web-based alternative (accessible from lab computers)
- Manual override system for faculty with proper logging
- Backup NFC/ID card system integration
- Allow retroactive attendance marking with proper documentation
- System to report device issues in advance

Edge Cases to Consider:

1. Technical Issues:
- App crashes during attendance marking
- Network connectivity issues
- GPS spoofing attempts
- Time zone complications for different campus locations
- Server downtime during critical marking periods

2. Physical Environment:
- Indoor locations with poor GPS signal
- Large lecture halls spanning multiple geofence areas
- Multiple classes happening simultaneously in nearby locations
- Students in buildings with multiple floors (3D location accuracy)
- Campus areas with overlapping geofences

3. Academic Scenarios:
- Student arriving late/leaving early
- Class location changes
- Emergency evacuations during class
- Field trips or off-campus classes
- Make-up classes in different locations

4. User Behavior:
- Students trying to mark attendance from nearby buildings
- Multiple login attempts from different devices
- Rapid switching between accounts
- Modified/rooted devices
- VPN usage affecting location data

Additional Security Measures:

1. Pattern Detection:
- Track and flag suspicious patterns (same device marking for multiple students)
- Analyze historical location data for inconsistencies
- Monitor device switching patterns
- Track attendance marking times for suspicious clusters

2. System Integrity:
- Regular security audits
- Encrypted location data
- Tamper detection for modified apps
- Rate limiting for attendance marking attempts
- Server-side verification of all client data
